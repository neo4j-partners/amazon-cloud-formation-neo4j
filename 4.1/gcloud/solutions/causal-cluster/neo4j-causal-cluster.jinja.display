    descriptionHtml: <p>Neo4j is used today by thousands of companies and organizations in almost all industries, including financial services, government, energy, technology, retail, and manufacturing (click here to see customers). Over 1,000 developers and architects across the industries are Neo4j Certified Professionals, and you can be too!</p><p>Neo4j is referred to as a native graph database because it implements the property graph model to the storage level and uses native graph processing (index-free adjacency). Neo4j does not just rely on graph processing and in-memory libraries, but also provides enterprise-required database capabilities including ACID transaction compliance, cluster support, and runtime failover, making it suitable to use graph data in production scenarios.</p>
    shortDescription: Neo4j is an open-source, NoSQL, native graph database that provides an ACID-compliant transactional backend for your applications. The Enterprise Edition includes all that Community Edition has to offer, plus extra enterprise requirements such as backups, clustering, and failover abilities.

This means that the data is stored exactly as you whiteboard it, and the database uses pointers to navigate and traverse the graph. In contrast to graph processing or in-memory libraries, Neo4j also provides full database characteristics, including ACID transaction compliance, cluster support, and runtime failover – making it suitable to use graphs for data in production scenarios.</p>
