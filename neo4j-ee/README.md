# Neo4j Enterprise Edition: AWS CloudFormation

CloudFormation templates and operator tooling for the Neo4j Enterprise Edition AWS Marketplace listing. Each template deploys a one or three-node Neo4j cluster fronted by a Network Load Balancer. Every node runs in a dedicated Auto Scaling group for self-healing, with a GP3 EBS data volume that is retained across stack deletion. Bolt TLS is optional on all three templates. Three topologies are available to match different infrastructure requirements: a public new-VPC deployment for evaluation, a private new-VPC deployment for production, and a private deployment into an existing VPC for environments with pre-existing network infrastructure.

## Templates

| Template | Topology | Use case | Guide |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Public** | New VPC, public subnets, internet-facing NLB | Proof of concept, demos, and evaluation. Instances have public IPs; no bastion required. Direct Bolt and Browser access from `AllowedCIDR`. | [docs/PUBLIC.md](docs/PUBLIC.md) |
| **Private** | New VPC, private subnets, internal NLB, SSM bastion | Production and staging where AWS manages the VPC. Instances have no public IPs; operator access via SSM Session Manager port forwarding through a dedicated bastion. | [docs/PRIVATE.md](docs/PRIVATE.md) |
| **Private, Existing VPC** | Your VPC, private subnets, internal NLB, SSM bastion | Production into a pre-existing network: peered VPC, Transit Gateway, or Direct Connect. No VPC or NAT provisioning; requires caller-supplied VPC and subnet IDs. | [docs/PRIVATE-EXISTING-VPC.md](docs/PRIVATE-EXISTING-VPC.md) |

## Sample Application

[`sample-private-app/`](sample-private-app/README.md) is a worked example of connecting an application workload to a Private-mode cluster. It covers the platform contract the EE stack publishes, the security group wiring required to reach the VPC interface endpoints, two Python 3.13 Lambdas behind IAM-authenticated Function URLs, and a resilience test that stops and restarts a follower via SSM.

## For Marketplace Users

Deploy from the AWS Marketplace listing. Once the stack is complete, the guide for your topology covers prerequisites, accessing the cluster, retrieving the password, observability checks, and tear down:

- **Public:** [docs/PUBLIC.md — General Operator Guide](docs/PUBLIC.md#general-operator-guide)
- **Private:** [docs/PRIVATE.md — General Operator Guide](docs/PRIVATE.md#general-operator-guide)
- **Private, Existing VPC:** [docs/PRIVATE-EXISTING-VPC.md — General Operator Guide](docs/PRIVATE-EXISTING-VPC.md#general-operator-guide)

## Local Development

All scripts read `AWS_PROFILE` from the environment and fall back to the `default` profile:

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=<your-profile>   # omit to use your default profile
```

> **Marketplace publishing scripts only** (`marketplace/create-ami.sh`, `marketplace/test-ami.sh`): these must run against the `neo4j-marketplace` account (`385155106615`). Set `AWS_PROFILE=marketplace` before running them. All other scripts work with any account that has CloudFormation, SSM, EC2, and IAM permissions.

### Deploy

```bash
# Private (default): 3-node cluster, t3.medium
./deploy.py --region us-east-1

# Public
./deploy.py --mode Public --region us-east-1

# Existing VPC
./deploy.py --mode ExistingVpc --vpc-id vpc-xxxx --subnet-1 subnet-xxxx

# Common flags (apply to all modes)
./deploy.py --number-of-servers 1           # single instance instead of 3-node
./deploy.py r8i.xlarge                      # memory-optimized instance type
./deploy.py --marketplace                   # use the published Marketplace AMI
./deploy.py --alert-email you@example.com   # enable CloudWatch alarm emails
```

### Look Up Connection Details

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
  --stack-name <stack-name> \
  --region <region> \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs' \
  --output table
```

### Tear Down

```bash
./teardown.sh                         # most recent deployment
./teardown.sh <stack-name>            # specific deployment
./teardown.sh --delete-volumes        # also permanently deletes EBS data volumes
```

EBS data volumes have `DeletionPolicy: Retain` and survive stack deletion by design. `teardown.sh` prints the retained volume IDs.

Multiple deployments can coexist; each gets its own file in `.deploy/`.

## Modifying Templates

The three output templates are assembled from source partials in `templates/src/`. Edit the partials, then regenerate:

```bash
cd templates
python build.py
```

Commit both the edited partial(s) and the regenerated template file(s). The `--verify` flag checks whether the committed output is current, useful in CI:

```bash
python build.py --verify
```

## Marketplace Reference

[docs/marketplace-reference.md](docs/marketplace-reference.md) covers the CloudFormation best practices required for the AWS Marketplace listing: security group patterns, IAM scoping, IMDSv2, AMI parameter type, and the full requirements checklist.
